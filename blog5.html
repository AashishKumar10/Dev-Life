    <h1>Blinkit Clone – UI & Branding <br> Experiment</h1>

    <img src="images/blog/blog4.4.png" alt="Family Website Screenshot" class="blog-img" />

    <p>During my frontend learning journey, I decided to recreate the Blinkit (formerly Grofers) homepage to better
      understand the importance of UI consistency and brand-focused design.</p>

    <p>The idea was simple — take inspiration from Blinkit’s clean, green-yellow themed layout and try to build a static
      clone using only HTML and CSS. I focused on designing the header section, search bar, categories, product cards,
      and the cart icon area. This project gave me practical experience in arranging grid layouts and maintaining visual
      hierarchy.</p>

    <p>One of the most exciting parts was selecting the right shades of green and yellow that match Blinkit's brand
      identity. I also worked on a promotional banner (with a cart icon) and practiced using icons, hover effects, and
      call-to-action buttons.</p>

    <p>Though the site doesn’t have backend functionality, this clone taught me how to balance colors, whitespace,
      typography, and responsive behavior for different screen sizes. It improved my confidence in UI/UX thinking, which
      is very useful while working on real e-commerce websites.</p>

    <p>This blog covers my full thought process — from layout structuring to pixel-perfect alignment — and how
      replicating real brand UIs can supercharge your frontend skills.</p>
