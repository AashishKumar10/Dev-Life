        <h1>My MCA Journey – Growth,<br> Learning & Coding</h1>

        <img src="images/blog/blog6.6.png" alt="Family Website Screenshot" class="blog-img" />

        <p>Completing my MCA (Master of Computer Applications) has been one of the most important milestones in my
            learning journey. The course gave me both theoretical foundation and practical experience in software
            development, database systems, and programming.</p>

        <p>During MCA, I worked on subjects like Operating Systems, DBMS, Java, and Web Technologies. I also improved my
            logic building, team collaboration, and presentation skills through mini projects and seminars.</p>

        <p>One of the most important things I learned during MCA was how to adapt to new technologies — like JavaScript
            frameworks, version control with Git, and understanding full-stack structures. I started doing personal
            practice alongside my course, including UI projects like family websites, product UIs, and more.</p>

        <p>The MCA experience not only helped me technically, but also shaped my time management, self-discipline, and
            communication skills. This blog is a personal reflection on how MCA helped me grow and how I’m now applying
            those learnings in real-world projects like MERN stack training and personal websites.</p>

        <p>If you're a student wondering whether MCA is the right path — I share exactly what worked for me, and how to
            make the most of it.</p>
