            As a passionate and dedicated web developer, I offer beginner to intermediate-level web development services
            focused on front-end technologies. My work primarily revolves around building responsive and visually
            appealing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I create clean UI designs, organize content structure
            effectively, and ensure that websites are accessible across different devices.
            <br><br>
            Whether you need a personal blog, a portfolio website, or a simple business landing page, I can design a
            solution tailored to your goals. I pay close attention to layout, color combinations, font readability, and
            modern design principles. I also replicate the layouts of popular websites such as Netflix, Blinkit, and
            Twitter to improve my skills and to demonstrate real-world website structure.
            <br><br>
            Some of the services I currently offer include:
        <ul style="padding-left: 80px; line-height: 50px; padding: 0 85px; text-align: justify;">
            <li>Responsive Web Page Design using HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Landing Pages for personal or local businesses</li>
            <li>Basic JavaScript-based features (like calculators or sliders)</li>
            <li>Website UI cloning for practice and learning</li>
            <li>Static project showcases with clean layout</li>
            <li>Integration of Font Awesome and Material Icons</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 22px; line-height: 30px; padding: 0 60px; text-align: justify;"> My projects follow a
            mobile-first approach, which means your website will look great not only on desktop but also on tablets and
            mobile phones. I also make sure that code is neat, properly commented, and easy to update for future
            changes.
            <br><br>
            I believe in continuous learning. Every project helps me grow — and I am always excited to take on new
            challenges. If you are someone who needs a basic yet beautiful website for learning, portfolio, or practice
            purposes, feel free to explore my work and connect.
